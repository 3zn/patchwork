- title: Plot Composition
  desc: >
    At the heart of patchwork lies a range of powerful functions for combining
    plots into an assembly of plots that can be layed out in a grid. Patchwork
    provides both an extension of ggplot2's `+` based API, along with a
    functinal interface.

- title: Layout Specifications
  desc: >
    While patchwork will automatically lay out the plots in a grid, additional
    control is often needed, along with the possibility of adding annotations
    etc.

    patchwork is build to work with ggplot2 but standard grobs can also be
    included. Further, it is possible to define empty areas if needed.
